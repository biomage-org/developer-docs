## Where to start
1. Choosing what to work on.

A good place to start is our [Trello board with user requests](https://trello.com/b/zPaytPFR/usability-studies). In there, we log all issues, reported by our users as well as their feature requests and we let them vote on what is most important. Pick a task, assign it to yourself and move it to "in progress" column. If you have any questions and for a technical chat about what is the best approach, message iva@biomage.net or marcell@biomage.net.

2. Fix a bug or improve existing docs.

Make a new card for this in our board: [Trello board with user requests](https://trello.com/b/zPaytPFR/usability-studies). Add @ivababukova from the core development team to the card. Assign it to yourself and move it to "in progress" column.

3. Have an idea about an awesome new feature that is not on the board yet.

How exciting, we want to hear more! Create a new card for this in our board: [Trello board with user requests](https://trello.com/b/zPaytPFR/usability-studies) and add @ vickymorrison who is our product owner. She will chat with you more and help you make wireframes if applicable.
